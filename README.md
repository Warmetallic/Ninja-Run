# Ninja-Run
Welcome to Ninka Run repository! This project represents the culmination of effort in creating an engaging and immersive gaming experience. It introduces additional features that enhance gameplay, making it a dynamic and enjoyable experience for players.

Key Features:

Enemies with Personality: We've introduced three distinct enemy types to add depth to the game. Meet the Imp, a StaticBody with a gif animation, blocking your pathway. The Imp is the easiest beast in the game, but beware, get too close, and you might get damaged. Then there's the Demon, a DynamicBody (Walker) with a gif animation, relentlessly walking towards the ninja, ready to strike. Last but not least, face the Boss, another DynamicBody (Walker) with a gif animation. The Boss is a formidable adversary with the ability to levitate and tease the player with an annoying laugh.

Immersive Sound Effects: Each enemy collision with a shuriken produces a unique sound effect that adds to the thrill. The Imp screams, the Demon laughs, and the Boss taunts with an annoying laugh. The game also features an awesome soundtrack that perfectly complements the game's atmosphere.

Shooting and Abilities: Now, your ninja has the power to shoot shurikens in any direction by pressing keys from num1 to num9, giving you 360-degree control. Num5 unleashes a mega attack, launching shurikens in all directions. Collect shurikens to defeat monsters and use them strategically to knock back the Boss. Every shot produces a sound, adding to the gaming experience.

Realistic Audio Feedback: Your ninja reacts with sound when jumping, picking up items, or meeting his demise. Quest items, such as the katana, nunchaku, and shuriken, emit special sounds when collected. These audio cues make the gaming process more immersive and engaging.

Enhanced User Interface: We've improved the user interface to provide clear instructions and inform players about how to control and enjoy the game fully.

This repository showcases the culmination of your efforts, creating a thrilling and immersive gaming experience. Dive into the world of enemies, sound effects, background music, and dynamic gameplay. Enjoy every moment of your ninja adventure!
